# TheLegendOfTrevorTheHoro
This platformer game was made for the Global GameJam 2018 in Beirut.
The gamejam theme was Transmission, so the game revolves around Trevor. This little hero is affected by special horoscopes that only
function in certain areas of the side scrolling map. One power is Hurricane: Trevor can spawn a hurricane to obliterate the randomly 
spawning skeletons and skeleton bosses. Another area that gives power is Strong Fist.
